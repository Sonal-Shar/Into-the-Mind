# Into-the-Mind

Into the mind is a game that focuses on sterotypes, foregrounding and backgrounding and representaion of mental health in media.
Each character represents a different thing.
The reason why they all seem to be monsters is because Donovan has derealisation, so the world looks different to him
This allows 
Mothers can sometimes be compared to the devil when strict, hence the demon-like look.
Fathers aren't always there for their children, hence the glitch-like look- it's as if he's not there or not supposed to be there.
Brother's are annoying and childish, so he has a doll-like look to him
Felicity has anxiety, so her monster is timid and small, with a mask to hide her face
Vince has an eating disorder, which is heavily distorted so he's seen as ugly by media
